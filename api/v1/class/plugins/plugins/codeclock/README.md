# CodeClock Plugin

This plugin allows you to clock in or out using a PIN to authenticate. The plugin is disabled by default and must be enabled in the `plugin.yml`.

## Usage

### View PIN

You can view your PIN by navigating to `Plugins` -> `[codeclock] View PIN`.

### Resetting PIN

Admins can reset only all PINs through the `Plugins` -> `[codeclock] Admin View` page.
